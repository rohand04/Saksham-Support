    <h2>About us</h2>
    <div class="story">
        <p>
           Welcome to Shaksham Support - a platform created to help and empower specially-abled (handicapped) people. Our mission is to provide the right information, support, and opportunities for those who need it the most. We built this website to make it easier for specially-abled individuals to understand and access different government schemes, benefits, and facilities that are available for them. Many people are not aware of the help and support they can receive, so we provide all the details in one place. Along with government schemes, we also share information about NGOs, foundations, and organizations that actively support and help specially-abled individuals. These NGOs provide financial help, education, health services, support programs, and guidance. We also list useful equipment and assistive devices that can help in daily life. These products are offered at affordable prices, making it easier for those in need to get the right equipment. At Shaksham Support, we believe everyone deserves equal opportunity, respect, and independence. Our goal is to connect people with the right resources and make their lives better, easier, and more confident.
